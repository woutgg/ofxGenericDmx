This add-on is built to control any DMX device, including the Enttec DMX USB PRO
and 'simpler' devices. Eventually it should work on all systems supported by
openFrameworks itself. For now OSX and GNU/Linux are supported, although
preliminary support for Windows can be found in the w32-port branch on GitHub.


# CREDITS
This add-on is based on the basic structure of the DMX512 add-on by Chris O'Shea and also uses code from that add-on for the USB PRO protocol. As second reference, the Enttec USB PRO example was used (see below in the links section).

# OS SPECIFIC NOTES

## OSX
 * On OSX this add-on uses libftdi (1.0, unreleased) and libusbx (1.0.12), which have been included. Depending on your programming environment, you might need to add the relevant library and include paths to your project configuration. As reference please take a look at the example supplied with the add-on.
 * The included libftdi has been compiled from their git repository and is versioned as '1.0'. The reason for not using an actual release is that libftdi-1.0 and libusbx together are sufficient for this add-on whereas the latest official release of libftdi requires and older libusb which on OSX can only be emulated by yet another wrapper library.
 * (OSX) If the add-on compiles, appears to open a device but does not send any data, it is likely you have the Ftdi VCP driver installed. This can be determined by checking if /dev/ttyUsbSerial exists. Note that (older) Arduino software also installs this driver.
   A temporary solution is to uninstall the driver (see Ftdi's installation guide: <http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm>). If things still do not work, try rebooting your computer.

## macOS Monterey 12.0
I was able to run the `ofxGenericDmx_RawDmxExample` from this addon with one minor modification in DmxUsbProDevice.cpp line 202.

```
    unsigned char reqParams[2];
    reqParams [0] = userConfigLength & 0xFF;
    reqParams [1] = ( userConfigLength >> 8    ) & 0xFF;
```
    
I also needed to exclude arm64 in order for the code to run (see screenshot).

This enabled me to use these openDMX devices

## Linux

### LibFTDI 
On GNU/Linux you just need to install the libFTDI  library. e.g. on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libftdi-dev
```

### Udev rules
By default, DMX controllers require root permissions; this can be fixed by using udev rules. An example rules file for the Enttec DMX USB PRO has been included (scripts/scripts/75-permissions-enttec.rules). Copy this file to /etc/udev/rules.d to use it.

To install the udev rules:
``` 
sudo cp 75-permissions-enttec.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

To reload the udev rules to make them active without rebooting:

``` 
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger 
```

### Custom Projects
If you are creating your own project, you need to add some extra configuration for libftdi

If using a Makefile, add this to config.make:
```
PROJECT_LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath=./libs
PROJECT_LDFLAGS+=-lftdi
```

If using qtCreator, add this to the .qbs file:
```
of.staticLibraries: ["ftdi"]
```

## Windows
 * While setting up a Code::Blocks project, the libraries will have to be added to link against. Make sure they end up in the right order: first libftdi, then libusb-compat and finally libusbx.

# MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
 * By lack of an RDM-capable device to test with, such features have not been added.
 * To recompile the libraries this add-on depends on, please see scripts/building-libs-howto.txt.
 * libftdi has a C++ wrapper; it depends on Boost however, so it isn't used in this add-on to avoid additional dependencies.

# LICENSE
This add-on is made available under the MIT license, see the file `LICENSE` for details.
Additionally, it uses the [libftdi](https://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/) and [libusbx](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusbx/) libraries, both released under the LGPL 2.0 license.
