This add-on is built to control any DMX device, including the Enttec DMX USB PRO
and 'simpler' devices. Eventually it should work on all systems supported by
openFrameworks itself. For now OSX and GNU/Linux are supported, although preliminary
support for Windows can be found in the w32-port branch on GitHub.

USAGE
This add-on uses libftdi (1.0, unreleased) and libusbx (1.0.12), which have been
included for OSX and GNU/Linux.
Depending on your programming environment, you might need to add the relevant
library and include paths to your project configuration. As reference please
take a look at the example supplied with the add-on.

The included libftdi has been compiled from their git repository and is
versioned as '1.0'. The reason for not using an actual release is that
libftdi-1.0 and libusbx together are sufficient for this add-on whereas the
latest official release of libftdi requires and older libusb which on OSX
can only be emulated by yet another wrapper library.

CREDITS
This add-on is based on the basic structure of the DMX512 add-on by Chris O'Shea
and also uses code from that add-on for the USB PRO protocol. As second reference,
the Enttec USB PRO example was used (see below in the links section).

OS SPECIFIC NOTES
- (OSX) If the add-on compiles, appears to open a device but does not
  send any data, it is likely you have the Ftdi VCP driver installed. This can
  be determined by checking if /dev/ttyUsbSerial exists.
  Note that (older) Arduino software also installs this driver. A temporary solution
  is to uninstall the driver (see Ftdi's installation guide:
  http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm).
- (Linux) By default, DMX controllers require root permissions; this can be
  fixed by using udev (see here: https://github.com/libusbx/libusbx/wiki/FAQ#wiki-Can_I_run_Linux_libusbx_applications_without_root_privilege).
  An example rules file for the Enttec DMX USB PRO has been included (scripts/scripts/75-permissions-enttec.rules),
  copy this file to /etc/udev/rules.d to use it.
- (Windows/Linux) While setting up a Code::Blocks project, the libraries will have to be added
  to link against. Make sure they end up in the right order: first libftdi, then
  libusb-compat and finally libusbx.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
- DmxRawDevice is untested.
- By lack of an RDM-capable device to test with, such features have not been added.
- To recompile the libraries this add-on depends on, please see scripts/building-libs-howto.txt.
- libftdi has a C++ wrapper; it depends on Boost however, so it isn't used in
  this add-on to avoid additional dependencies.
